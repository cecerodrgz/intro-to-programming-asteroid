Cecilia Rodriguez

About
I was born in Honduras, and I have been living in the United States for 6 years now.
I have always lived in the Cary-Raleigh area and so far I really like it.
My mother lenguage is Spanish, but learned English when I was younger, which was helpful once I moved here.


Experience
I have no previous experience with coding, but have always been interested about it. Previously I was doing a 
CCNA course with Cisco, but I like coding more.
