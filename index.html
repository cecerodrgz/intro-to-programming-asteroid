            <h1><strong>About</strong></h1>
            <h2><em>Cecilia Rodriguez</em></h2>
            <p>I was born in Honduras, and I have been living in the United States for 6 years now.<br>
            I have always lived in the Cary-Raleigh area and so far I really like it.<br>
            My mother language is Spanish, but learned English when I was younger, which was helpful once I moved here.<br>
            I enjoy listening to true crime and horror podcast. I also have many hobbies, like acrylic painting, knitting; which are the ones I enjoy the most.<br>
            I am the middle child of three, and the only daughter.<br>
            Moving to a different country has been challenging, but I have had fun with it.</p>

                <h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2>
                <p>I have no previous experience with coding, but have always been interested about it. Previously I was doing a CCNA course with Cisco, but I like coding more. So far, the JavaScript part has been more difficult than anything.
